- model_3: former model of Arthur, based on current efficiency instead of previous efficiency (+0 on trial 1 of each run which should not be here)
- model_4: former model of Arthur like model_3 (see above) but binary output (0/1) for choices instead of (0/0.25/0.75/1)
- model_5: model using previous efficiency instead of current efficiency as initially intended
- model_6: same as model_5 but using binary output (0/1) for choices instead of (0/0.25/0.75/1)
