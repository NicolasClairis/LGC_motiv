%
% INPUTS
% resultsFolder: folder where bayesian data is stored
%
% subBehaviorFolder: folder where subject data is stored
%
% sub_nm: string with subject CID name
%
% run_nm: string with run name
%
% task_fullName: task full name 'mental'/'physical'
%
% mdl_nm: model name (should be a string with the form 'mdl_X' with X being
% the model number)
%
% OUTPUTS
% NV_chosen_min_unch: 1*nTrials vector with information about the net value of the 
% chosen - unchosen option for the current study, subject and run.
%
% deltaNV_hE_min_lE: 1*nTrials vector with information about the net value of the 
% high effort option - low effort option for the current study, subject and run.
%
% confidence_highE: 1*nTrials vector with information about the confidence
% inferred by the model for the current study, subject and run. Confidence
% is computed in reference of the high effort option as [p(high E)-0.5]Â²
%
% pChoice: 1*nTrials vector with information about the probability of
% choosing the high effort option for the current study, subject and run.
%
% deltaNV_hE_min_lE_plus_bias: 1*nTrials vector with deltaNV_hE_min_lE + bias 
% (ie everything used for p(choice) before softmax transformation.
%
% NV_ch_min_unch_with_bias: 1*nTrials vector with information about the net value of the 
% chosen - unchosen option for the current study, subject and run. Same as
% NV_chosen_min_unch, but also including bias (ie same as pChoice before
% the sigmoid transformation)
